MCP Bundle
====================================================

What is MCPB?
-------------

The **Model Context Protocol Bundle (MCPB)** is a standardized packaging format designed to simplify the distribution and usage of Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers. For **ToolUniverse**, the MCPB wraps the entire ecosystem—including Python dependencies, the Node.js bridge, and the server logic—into a single, standalone executable or bundle.

Why use MCPB with ToolUniverse?
-------------------------------

Traditionally, running an MCP server like ToolUniverse required setting up a specific Python environment, installing dependencies.

**MCPB solves this by providing:**

*   **Zero Configuration**: No need to manage Python virtual environments or install Node.js manually.
*   **One-Click Installation**: In supported clients like Claude Desktop, you just drop the `.mcpb` file.
*   **Portability**: The bundle contains everything needed to run ToolUniverse on your machine.

Key Features
------------

*   **Standalone Execution**: The bundle acts as a self-contained server.
*   **Seamless Integration**: Designed specifically for **Claude Desktop** and other MCPB-aware clients.
*   **Access to Scientific Tools**: Immediately unlocks 1000+ scientific tools for your AI assistant without command-line setup.

Getting Started
---------------

To use the ToolUniverse MCPB:

1.  Download the latest release from our `GitHub Releases <https://github.com/mims-harvard/ToolUniverse/releases/tag/mcpb>`_.
2.  Follow the instructions in the `official Claude Desktop Guide <https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/desktop-extensions>`_ to configure it with your client.

Client compatibility note
-------------------------

MCPB support depends on the client. For Claude Desktop, use the MCPB release
flow above. For Claude Code, add ToolUniverse directly as a stdio MCP server
instead of installing the MCPB bundle:

.. code-block:: bash

   claude mcp add --transport stdio tooluniverse -- tooluniverse

This keeps Claude Code on the regular ToolUniverse command path while MCPB
clients can continue using the bundled release.

For advanced users who wish to build the bundle from source or understand the protocol details, please refer to the :doc:`MCP Support <mcp_support>` documentation.
